# Hello markdown!

It is **so** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hang of *it*, you just:

* remember the basic syntax
* write your document
* done!
Now you can be a wiz at this language and code up stuff like 'console.writeline("Hello, Markdown!")';

Can't remember the language? No problem! Just visit one of these resources:
